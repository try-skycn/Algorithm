	It is obviously that we can use $ \log(m) $ bits to store a integer which is at most $ m $. So we can add $ \sigma(a_{i}) $ to $ X $ as soon as we get the value of $ a_{i} $. In fact, it need $ 2\log(m) $ bits, half of the bits stores $ Re(X) $ and the rest stores $ Im(X) $. After a long time of discussion, we don't know how to do it in only $ \log(m) $ bits.
